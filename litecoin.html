    <h1>Litecoin Chart</h1>
    <p>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee in 2011 as an alternative to Bitcoin. It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but with significant differences, such as a shorter block generation time and a different hashing algorithm. Litecoin has gained widespread acceptance and is now traded on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
