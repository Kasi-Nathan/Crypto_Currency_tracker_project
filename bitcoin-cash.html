    <h1>Bitcoin Cash Chart</h1>
    <p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2017 as a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain. It was created to address some of the scalability issues of Bitcoin by increasing the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. Bitcoin Cash has gained widespread acceptance and is now accepted by many merchants and businesses as a form of payment.</p>
