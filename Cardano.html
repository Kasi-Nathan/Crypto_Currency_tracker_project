    <h1>Cardano Chart</h1>
    <p>Cardano is a decentralized platform that is designed to allow developers to create smart contracts and decentralized applications. It was created by IOHK, a blockchain research and development company, and launched in 2017. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work mechanism used by Bitcoin.</p>
