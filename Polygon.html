	<h1>Lido Staked Ether (STETH)</h1>

	<p>Lido Staked Ether (STETH) is an ERC-20 token that represents a stake in the Ethereum network. It is created by depositing Ether (ETH) into the Lido protocol, which pools the ETH together and stakes it on the Ethereum network. This allows STETH holders to earn rewards for participating in the network without having to manage their own validators or maintain a minimum balance of ETH.</p>

			<h2 class="card-title">How it works</h2>
			<p class="card-text">Here is a high-level overview of how the Lido protocol works:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ETH is deposited into the Lido smart contract</li>
				<li>Lido mints a corresponding amount of STETH and sends it to the depositor</li>
				<li>The deposited ETH is pooled together with other deposits</li>
				<li>The pooled ETH is staked on the Ethereum network</li>
				<li>STETH holders earn rewards based on the amount of ETH they have staked</li>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Lido Staked Ether (STETH) is a token that represents your stake in the Ethereum network. By staking your ETH with Lido, you can earn staking rewards without having to manage your own validator node.</p>
        <p>When you deposit ETH into Lido, it is converted into staked Ether (a tokenized representation of your stake) and sent to the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract. The validators then use your staked Ether to participate in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus mechanism and earn rewards, which are then distributed back to you.</p>
        <p>Redeeming your STETH for ETH is easy. Simply send your STETH to the Lido contract address and you'll receive ETH in return. Note that there may be a slight delay as the underlying ETH is unstaked and transferred back to you.</p>
