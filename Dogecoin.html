    <p>Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that was created in 2013. It is based on the popular "Doge" internet meme and was initially developed as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Dogecoin has since gained a strong following and has become a popular cryptocurrency for tipping and microtransactions.</p>
