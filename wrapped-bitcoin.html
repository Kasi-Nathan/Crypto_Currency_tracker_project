    <h1>Wrapped Bitcoin Chart</h1>
    <p>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 token that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. It is designed to bring greater liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem and enable new decentralized applications that require Bitcoin's security and liquidity. WBTC is backed by a group of custodians who hold the underlying Bitcoin and mint WBTC tokens in a 1:1 ratio. WBTC can be traded on decentralized exchanges, used as collateral for loans, and integrated into other Ethereum-based applications.</p>
